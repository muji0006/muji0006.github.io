        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Katok Mujing. I’m studying in Interactive Media Design, which mixes creativity and technology. 
            I really enjoy learning how to make visuals, websites, and other digital projects. 
            I also have a big passion for cinema — I love creating stories and thinking about how visuals, music, and emotions connect together in a film.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m a very open person who likes to talk and connect with others. 
            I enjoy sharing ideas and working on projects with people who think differently. 
            I believe that being open-minded helps me grow and see things from new perspectives every day.
